## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the code for **Lab 4** in CSE 120. The lab focuses on **working with dictionaries, loops, and user input** in Python.  

The program allows the user to:  
1. Enter multiple **car makes and models** into a dictionary  
2. Query the dictionary for a specific **car model** and display its corresponding make  

The goal of this lab was to practice:  
- Using **dictionaries** to store and retrieve data  
- Using **while loops** for repeated input  
- Handling **user queries** and validating input  
- Printing **formatted output**
